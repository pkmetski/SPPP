Write a TCP forwarder
Design: 0.5 hr
Code: 8 hr
Comments: Would have been easier if I were more confident in Thread programming. I wonder why so many sockets must be openened.


Write a drop-in replacement for DatagramSocket

Implement an RFC862 server
Design: 0.5 hr
Code: 5 hr
Comments: I wish I've done this task before the TCPForwarder, because basically it is a UDPServer and TCPServer in one.


Write programs to estimate UDP datagram loss
Design: 1hr
Code: 3hr
Comments: Since we found it impossible to establish a connection between two computers on the ITU WiFi network, or between two computers on ITU wired network, we ran the tests only locally.
For a packet size of 255 bytes, 500 packets transferred and 1 ms between transfers there were no packets lost or duplicated.
We believe, however, that this would not be the case for a WiFi connection. Our expectations are there would be packet loss due to interference.
Even more so for the Internet setup, since a packet is to pass through multiple routers.


Write programs to reliably communicate over UDP
Design: 3hr
Code: 4hr
Comments: I believe was a too big task for a mini project. It could have easily been a project on its own.
